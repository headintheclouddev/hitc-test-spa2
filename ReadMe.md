# HITC Hello World SPA
## Summary
This is meant to be step 1 (Hello World) in creating a NetSuite Single Page Application.
The walkthrough video for this project is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXoQnS2pyFw

## SPA Lessons learned:
1. Always (as much as possible) use UIF components rather than standard HTML elements.
2. Even though there are simpler state-management options, life will be easier if you give in and do things in the UIF Redux way.
   In other words, your app is more likely to work and you'll have fewer headaches if you take the time to use Redux.
